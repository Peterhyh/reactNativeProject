4) Short bio: Hi! I'm Myro and have just recently begun my coding journey! Currently attending UPenn's LPS full stack coding bootcamp, I am excited to be part of FIDIM to foster collaboration amongst peers, be part of a creative network, and learn from like-minded devs. In my free time you can find me spending time with my children solving jigsaw puzzles, outside jogging, reading, or on the computer editing short videos!
